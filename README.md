# Description

[Live Demo](https://sso.namdao.dev/)

This is a Serverless SSO service for my web applications. Its powered by Bcryptjs for password hashing, Jose for JWT and [Worktop's Router](https://github.com/lukeed/worktop) for routing HTTP requests.

Due to the limitation of the worker's 10ms cpu limit, passwords are only hashed up to 5 salt rounds (The recommended is 10). Users info are stored in Workers KV, a globally distributed, eventually consistent key value store.

This costs $0 to maintain, due to Cloudflare's generous workers free teir (100,000 req/day). Noice ðŸ˜Ž
